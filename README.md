# Colonies Plugin

Explanation goes here.


# Ideas

Nothing planned, just totally overambitious thinking!

## Factions

Should consist of base game NPCs, but no human colonists. Humans are players and are distinct from colony NPCs

### Undead
- Don't need food or sleep.
- Skeletons, zombies, evil wizards and npc's
- Player is a necromancer
- Create undead by:
    - Finding crypt or graveyard on map, need to build something there
    - Or collecting souls by slaying mobs with specific item

### Kweebec & friendly races
- Need to be recruited in the world and befriended?
- Can have children
- Klops as merchants
- Better trade or science?

### Constructs and mechanisms
- Player needs to construct colonists using gears and mechanical objects.
    - Ideally not anything not in base game. (Perhaps magic crystals etc.)
- Don't need food or sleep.

### Goblins
- Lot of goblins but lot of chaos
- Maybe player is a mean bastard, you can't rule goblins with a soft hand... Smack goblins to get them to listen or recruit some trorks to smack them for you!

## Systems

### Names and personality
- Perhaps certain factions can't name certain colonists (skeletons, automatons, etc.) but each faction should have special, unique and interesting colonists outside of that.

### Raids and attacks

Dragons, goblins, orcs, enemy colonies, etc.
- Maybe a system where other colonies periodically generate raiding parties?

### Reputation system

- Reputation with different factions?
- Do colonies belong to a faction? Do you choose to join a faction?

### Border protection


### Quest system

- Internal colony quests (no items that colony doesn't generate, but maybe a boost to production or research?)
    - Perhaps lock certain advancement behind specific quests
- Wandering NPC quest for special rewards
- Global quests where colonies need to work together

### Trade system

- Unique resources on the map that are spread out, so only one colony can acquire them. Making trade more usefull or even necessary for progression.

### PVP system

- Should reward winner, but not necessarily punish loser?
- Or alternatively add a hardcore setting where there is real loss.
- Perhaps there should be a way to 

### Religion system
### Magic system
